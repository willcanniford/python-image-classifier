# Python Image Classifier
Image classifier notebook with command line scripts for training neural networks for image detection.


As part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree, I completed a project that trained a neural network on photographs of different species, and then predicts the flower species of an unseen photo using that network.  

In this repository you are going to find a notebook that goes through the training process and the code that makes the base for the scripts that allow the neural network to be trained at the command line. I use transfer learning to improve performance and improve the training time of the network as a whole.  

Additionally the scripts allow for the use of different networks as the base, the use of a gpu and a variety of hyperparameters and then saving the weights trained somewhere so that you are able to read it in later without having to train the network each time. 

*Note: this repository might not contain the images that were used to train the network during the process of course.*
